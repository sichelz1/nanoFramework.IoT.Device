# VL53L1X - distance sensor

The VL53L1X is a state-of-the-art, Time-of-Flight (ToF), laser-ranging sensor. It is the fastest miniature ToF sensor on the market with accurate ranging up to 4 m and fast ranging frequency up to 50 Hz housed in a miniature and reflowable package, it integrates a SPAD receiving array, a 940 nm invisible Class1 laser emitter, physical infrared filters, and optics to achieve the best ranging performance in various ambient lighting conditions with a range of cover window options.
Unlike conventional IR sensors, the VL53L1X uses STâ€™s latest generation ToF technology which allows absolute distance measurement whatever the target color and reflectance.
It is also possible to program the size of the ROI on the receiving array, allowing the sensor FoV to be reduced

## Usage

All calibration and all setup of the sensor is done fully transparently for you including changing the I2C address of the device. Just create a class and start reading the distance.

```csharp
Vl53L1X vl53L1X = new(i2cAddress: newI2CAddress, xShutPin: xShutPinNo);

Console.WriteLine($"SensorID: {vl53L1X.GetSensorId():X}");

while (!Console.KeyAvailable)
{
   try
   {
      var dist = vl53L1X.Distance;
      var rangeStatus = vl53L1X.GetRangeStatus();
      Console.WriteLine($"RangeStatus {rangeStatus}");
      Console.WriteLine($"Distance: {dist}");
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
      Console.WriteLine($"Exception: {ex.Message}");
   }


   Thread.Sleep(500);
}
```
